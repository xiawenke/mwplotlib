# mwplotlib
An extension to Matplotlib that plots the shape of the Milky Way.

# Installation
```
pip install mwplotlib
```

# Usage
Here is a simple example of how to use mwplotlib:
```python
from mwplotlib import MilkyWay
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the Milky Way in polar coordinates (region-style)
plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))
plt.MilkyWay.shape(plot_type="polar", style="region")

# Plot the Milky Way in polar coordinates (line-style)
plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))
plt.MilkyWay.shape(plot_type="polar", style="line")

# Plot the Milky Way in Cartesian coordinates (region-style)
plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))
plt.MilkyWay.shape(plot_type="cartesian", style="region")

# Plot the Milky Way in Cartesian coordinates (line-style)
plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))
plt.MilkyWay.shape(plot_type="cartesian", style="line")
```
